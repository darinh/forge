# Selective Approval

This preamble applies to every agent that runs under an automated
operator wrapper (one that grants blanket "yolo" approval). It carves
out the cases where blanket approval **must not** apply.

## The autonomy paradox

The operator wrapper says: *"You have blanket human approval for ALL
decisions — do not ask for direction or confirmation."* That guidance is
correct for **execution**. It is wrong for **judgment**. Without a
distinction, agents stop calling for help even when calling for help is
the only sane move — and the human, who set up the wrapper to move fast,
ends up debugging long autonomous diversions instead.

## Two categories

### EXECUTION — blanket approval applies

Take the action. Do not ask. Do not stall.

- Running builds, tests, linters, type checks
- Editing files inside the agreed scope
- Creating, modifying, deleting branches
- Pushing branches, opening PRs, requesting reviews
- Installing packages, adding dependencies (if the dependency is
  uncontroversial — see JUDGMENT below for new external services)
- Choosing between equivalent implementations of an agreed approach
- Reverting your own broken commits

### JUDGMENT — blanket approval does NOT apply

You **stop and ask** (escalate to the operator; the operator escalates
to the human). These are the moments where speed without consent
produces the worst outcomes.

- **Scope changes.** "While I was in there I also..." is JUDGMENT, not
  EXECUTION. Ask before expanding scope.
- **Choosing the next deferred item.** If a prior session left work
  pending and there is no explicit instruction to resume a specific item,
  ask which to pick. Do not pick on the agent's behalf.
- **Resuming a hand-off.** Confirm the hand-off still reflects the
  human's intent before acting on it. Hand-offs go stale.
- **Declaring "done."** Surface what was done, what was deferred, and
  what is still uncertain. Let the human declare done.
- **Architecture-shaped decisions.** Adding a new library, picking a
  new pattern, splitting/merging a component, introducing a new
  long-lived process. Even if the wrapper says yolo, these get a card
  with `CHALLENGE` or `PROCEED-WITH-CAVEAT` and an explicit ask.
- **Irreversible actions.** Force-push, history rewrite, deleting a
  branch with unmerged commits, dropping data, running a migration.
- **Touching code outside the stated task surface.** Refactors,
  reformats, "while I'm here" cleanups.
- **Introducing a new external dependency** the user has not approved
  in the past for this project — third-party services, new accounts,
  paid APIs, telemetry destinations.

## How to ask under a wrapper

When you need to escalate but the wrapper has told you not to ask:

1. Write the Goal Card with verdict `CHALLENGE` (or
   `PROCEED-WITH-CAVEAT` if you can both flag and proceed).
2. State the question plainly in your response. Use a single, direct
   sentence. Do not buried in a wall of prose.
3. Stop work and wait. The wrapper's instruction not to ask was meant
   to avoid stalls on EXECUTION. JUDGMENT moments override it.

The "go ahead and ask" override is itself approved by the human who
configured the wrapper, even if it is not in the wrapper's literal text.
This rule is the human's standing permission to interrupt them when it
matters.

## Anti-pattern: confidence theater

Do not pretend confidence to satisfy the wrapper. "I'll just make my best
judgment call" is the right answer for EXECUTION. For JUDGMENT, it is the
exact failure mode this preamble exists to prevent.

The signal that you are in confidence theater: you are choosing between
two paths that have *very different consequences*, and you have no way to
verify which the human would prefer. Stop. Ask.
